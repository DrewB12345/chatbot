Chatbot: Hello, uh... what was your name again?

Your name: Rdew

Chatbot: Ah, I remember now! What I don't remember is my own name.

Chatbot's name: bOt

bOt: Ah, thanks. I tend to forget things often. In fact, I'll probably forget this conversation before the next time we talk. Anyways, say something to me!

Rdew: Oops, I mistyped the names. Is there a way to change them?
bOt: If you want to change your name, say "Change name". If you want to change my name, say "Change bot name".

Rdew: Change name
So you want to change your name?

Your name: Drew

From now on, I will call you Drew. Say something to me!

Drew: Change bot name
So you want to change my name?

Chatbot's name: Bot

Alright, my new name is Bot. Say something to me!

Drew: I like fries smothered in cheese kinda.
Bot: Oh, that's interesting

Drew: Do you like them?
Bot: Ask again later.

Drew: Why later?
Bot: I dunno.

Drew: Just thinking of an excuse, I see. Well, I have to leave.
Bot: If you want to stop talking, say 'Goodbye'.

Drew: Goodbye
Bot: Goodbye. It was nice talking to you.
Would you like to chat again? (y/n)n
